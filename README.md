# 2.1-Fifa21-project
Fifa21 project - Data preprocessing, LM model building and validation

## Training/Test accuracy of 0.89 and validation accuracy of 0.86 with 39 features

## Could also increase the validation accuracy by more of +0.02 to bring the validation accuracy to 0.88 but had to include 8 more features to help achieve that, so we decided to leave that out, to limit the size of the model.
